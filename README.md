## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here.
   - A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes want to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends.

- What is the background of your project?
  - build a multiple linear regression model for the prediction of demand for shared bikes
  
- What is the business probem that your project is trying to solve?
   - Company want to understand factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market. The company wants to know:
   A. Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
   B. How well those variables describe the bike demands


- What is the dataset that is being used?
   - day.csv

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->
